    <h1>Spaghetti</h1>
    <img href="img/spaghetti.jpeg" alt="Beautiful, fresh spaghetti with parmasean cheese on top.">
    <h3>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti will always hold a <em>very</em> special place in my heart. It will always be my
        favorite dish that both my parents could ever make. I will never forget the way my mouth salivates 
        when I smell the sweet aroma sweeping throught the house. I have had many spaghetti dishes from a 
        wide variety of places through out my years on this earth yet this one will always be my favorite.</p>
        <p>It is outrageously simple and even uses store bought spaghetti sauce because if it aint broke don't 
        fix it, right? Another controversial piece of the recipe is the use of angel hair noodles instead of 
        their thicker siblings. But to all the haters, poop you.</p>
